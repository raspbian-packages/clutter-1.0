      part the cogl package

    - removing patch as this is now fixed with upstream and cogl

  [ Sjoerd Simons ]
  * let libcutter-1.0 breaks libcogl5. Clutter needs a new cogl soname, which
    means it breaks apps that use both it and cogl directly. As there no
    applications using cogl that don't use clutter, doing a break directly on
    libcogl5 is the most elegant solution
