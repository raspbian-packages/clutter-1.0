        C API to define keys for an animation, but this will
        typically be much more verbose than the JSON equivalent.</p><p>One other advantage of JSON is that it is much simpler
        to tweak and test an animation, as you don't have to recompile
        the application each time you edit it (you just load

      as a way to give directions to actors. For example,
      you could give a real (human) actor a direction like "move
      downstage; when you get there, stop and
      rotate 90 degrees to your right". In code,
      this might equate to a transition in the <code class="varname">x</code>
      and <code class="varname">y</code> properties of the actor, followed by a
      rotation in one axis.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p><span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span> can give
        "directions" to any type of GObject, but we concentrate
        on animating <span class="type">ClutterActors</span> in this section.</p></div><p>Each direction like this has an implicit
      timeline, spanning the length of time the direction should
      take to fulfil (you set the length of the timeline through
      the <code class="varname">duration</code> property of the
      <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span>). But within that timeline, you may
      change the proportion of time spent on each action: "move
      downstage quickly, then slowly rotate 90 degrees
      to your right". The direction is the same, but we've
      specified how much of the timeline should be devoted to each
      action.</p><p>In <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span>, this concept is
      captured by <span class="emphasis"><em>key frames</em></span>. A
      key frame represents a point somewhere along the timeline,
      with one or more target property values for one or more actors.
      A <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span> manages the transitions
      between property values for each object, ensuring that
      the target values are reached when the associated key frame
      is reached.</p><p>To change the amount of time a transition
      should take, you change the percentage of the timeline
      between key frames. Using our real stage directions as an
      example, you might define the key frames like this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>0.2 (after 20% of the timeline):</em></span>
          arrive downstage</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>1.0 (by the end of the timeline):</em></span>
          achieve a 90 degree rotation to the right</p></li></ul></div><p>See
      <a class="link" href="animations-complex.html#animations-complex-discussion-keys" title="5.3.1. Understanding keys and key frames">this
      section</a> for more details about keys and key frames.</p><p>Finally, a direction might be further refined with
      a description of the kind of movement to use:
      rather than saying "move downstage quickly, then
      slowly rotate 90 degrees to your right" a director could say:
      "start off slowly, but build up to a run;
      run downstage quickly; then stop and start rotating
      slowly to your right, gradually speeding up, turn a little more, then slow
      down gradually; you should end up rotated 90 degrees to your right"
      (this granularity of description is closer to what you might
      see in dance notation like
      <a class="ulink" href="" target="_top">Laban</a>;
      though of course you can't animate human opacity, scale, dimensions
      etc...).</p><p><span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span> gives you this level of
      granularity. Each transition to a property value between
      key frames can have a separate <span class="emphasis"><em>easing mode</em></span>:
      for example, starting off slowly and building to a constant
      speed equates to an "ease in" mode; starting slowly, speeding
      up, maintaining a constant speed, then gradually slowing down
      equates to "ease in and ease out".</p><p>To summarise: creating a complex animation means deciding:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Which properties need to change on which actors?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What target value should each property transition to?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How quickly (by which key frame) should the property

        <code class="varname">name</code> (name of the property

        property (position on the x axis) of the <code class="code">rectangle</code>
        object, as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>[ 0.0, "linear", 0.0 ]</em></span>:
            At the start of the animation, <code class="code">x</code> should be
            0.0; <code class="code">linear</code> is used as the easing mode, as there
            is no transition here.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>[ 0.1, "easeInCubic", 150.0 ]</em></span>:
            By 10% of the way through the animation,
            <code class="code">x</code> should reach a value of <code class="code">150.0</code>.
            This moves the rectangle horizontally across the stage.</p><p>The <code class="code">easeInCubic</code> easing mode means that
            the transition to the new value starts slow and speeds up.
            This makes the movement look more "natural".</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>[ 0.8, "linear", 150.0 ]</em></span>:
            From 10% of the way through the animation to 80%
            of the way through, the <code class="code">x</code> value remains at
            <code class="code">150.0</code>. This makes the rectangle stay still
            on the x axis throughout this period.</p><p>It's important to specify interim key frames if
            in a later key frame you intend to change the value again
            (as is done for the <code class="code">x</code> value here). Otherwise
            you can get premature transitions to a value over longer
            periods than you intended. By specifying the interim
            key frames where the value remains constant, you ensure
            that it doesn't change before you want it to.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>[ 1.0, "easeInCubic", 0.0 ]</em></span>:
            From 80% of the way through the animation to the end,
            the <code class="code">x</code> value should transition back to
            <code class="code">0.0</code>. This moves the actor back to its
            starting position on the x axis. Again, an <code class="code">easeInCubic</code>
            easing mode is used to make the transition appear more natural.</p></li></ol></div><p>There are two more properties you can set for each
        object/property pair:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Set <code class="varname">ease-in</code> to <code class="code">true</code> to
            animate to the target value at the first key frame. If

            "jump" to the target value instead (if the target value is
            different from the current value).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Set <code class="varname">interpolation</code> to either
            <code class="code">"linear"</code> (the default) or <code class="code">"cubic"</code>.
            This sets how <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span> transitions between
            key frames; in effect, it further modulates any easing modes
            set on individual keys: if set to <code class="code">"cubic"</code>, you
            get a slightly more natural and gentle transition between
            key frames than you do if set to <code class="code">"linear"</code>.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="animations-complex-why-clutteranimator"></a>5.3.2. Why <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span>?</h4></div></div></div><p>Why use <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span> and not the other

            properties on a single actor; however, you can only specify a
            single transition for each property. Also, it's not possible
            to describe complex movement along a path in a single implicit
            animation: you would have to chain several animations together
            to do that.</p><p>To animate multiple actors, you'd also need multiple
            implicit animations, one for each actor. These animations would
            also need to be synchronized (for example, by sharing a
            single timeline).</p><p>So it would be possible, but more difficult than
            an implementation using <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em><span class="type">ClutterState</span></em></span> can
            be used for complex animations: each state can describe
            transitions for multiple actors and multiple properties.
            However, to make continuous movement (as in the example),
            you would need to write a state for each movement between a
            pair of points; then add a callback so that when each state
            is reached, the animation moves onto the next state. This
            adds some code (a handler for the <code class="code">completed</code>
            signal emitted by the <span class="type">ClutterState</span> to set
            the next state). This could work OK for a few states,
            but doesn't scale as well as <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span>
            if you have many transitions.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p><span class="type">ClutterState</span> and
              <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span> are not mutually exclusive. If
              you generally need to transition between several known states
              (e.g. hiding/revealing menus which stay in the same place,
              moving between two UI layouts), but want to create a
              complex animation between states, you can use
              <span class="type">ClutterAnimators</span> to define the transitions: see
              the documentation for
              <code class="function">clutter_state_set_animator()</code> for
              details.</p></div></li></ul></div><p><span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span> is a good fit for complex
        animations, and probably the best fit for the most complex:
        it is the simplest way to encode a sequence of transitions
        for a list of object/property pairs which can be treated
        as a single animation. This is largely because
        <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span> is effectively managing the
        chaining together of the individual transitions into a whole.</p><p>One other feature of <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span> which
        isn't demonstrated here is how it enables transitions to overlap.
        For example, let's say you wanted an actor
        to move along a complex path (e.g. described by five pairs of
        x,y coordinates); but during that movement, you
        wanted the actor to continuously transition to a scale of
        4.0 on both the x and y axes.</p><p>To achieve this with <span class="type">ClutterState</span>, you would
        need to set up five transitions (one to move to each pair of
        x,y coordinates); plus a callback to chain the state transitions
        together; and within each transition, you'd have to figure out a
        percentage of the scaling to apply, so that the actor
        was at a scale of 4.0 on reaching the final state.</p><p>With <span class="type">ClutterAnimator</span>, you can treat the
        movement between the coordinates and the scaling separately
        within the same animation, but overlap their key frames. This
